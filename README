Arduino Wiring:


TFT Display:

    The display pins are numbered left to right in this document when they are being viewed
    with their labels showing rightside up. Note you do not require the touchscreen for this assignment,
    so it is probably a lot easier to not wire the Y+/X+/Y-/X- pins.

    Display Pin     Arduino Mega Pin
    1 GND           BB GND bus
    2 Vin           BB Vcc (+ive) bus

    4 CLK           Pin 52
    5 MISO          Pin 50

Upload Instructions

  enter the A1P2 directory from the terminal
  Enter client directory and type "make upload"
  Enter server directory and type "python3 server.py"

Problems we faced while writing the program
  There was confusion when we were creating the closest_vertices function.
  We could not figure it out ourselves so we needed the TA's assistance in
  making the function.
  Also, there was a problem when calling the least_cost_path function. It
  would always return that there was no vertex in the graph. However, this
  turned out the be a mistake when we were calling the function from the
  arduino_talk.

Changes made to client
  made a client_to_Server function which communicates with the server,
  using a finite state machine to get the waypoints.
  made a draw_route function which draws a line connection the waypoints.
  called these functions in the int main()

Changes make to server
  Included a closest_vertices function with the assistance of the TA
  Created an arduino_talk function that allows the server to communicate
  with the arduino through encoding and decoding ASCII values.
